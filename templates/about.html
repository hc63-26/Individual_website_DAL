            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                With a strong foundation in marketing and digital business, I bring a global perspective and
                creative mindset to solving modern business challenges. I recently graduated from Indiana
                University's Kelley School of Business with a degree in Marketing and Digital & Social Media
                Business Applications, along with a minor in Apparel Merchandising.
            </p>
            <p> This fall, I continued at Kelley as a Master's student in Information Systems (MSIS). As I
                step into the next chapter of my academic and professional journey, I'm focused on deepening my
                skills at the intersection of technology, data, and strategy. I'm especially drawn to roles that
                blend creative problem-solving with digital innovation, where I can help design and implement
                systems that improve efficiency, enhance user experiences, and drive strategic outcomes. </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited to continue exploring opportunities where I can connect business and technology to drive
                meaningful impact. 
            </p>
