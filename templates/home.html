            Hi, my name is Queeny Chen. I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at Indiana
            University's Kelley School of Business. I focus on data-driven product decisions, systems
            integrations, and creating practical analytics for real business problems. I enjoy working at the
            intersection of business and technology: translating requirements into clean data pipelines and
            actionable dashboards. I have a background in marketing and digital business applications, along
            with hands-on experience in enterprise systems, data analytics, and e-commerce operations from
            internships across the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
